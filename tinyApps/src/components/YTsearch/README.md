# YTsearch
###### Pre-requisite: Python 3.0 or higher installed<br>

A small application that searches through YouTube, and gives back the search results in a browser.<br>
It can run instantly after giving it a search query, and has two different modes of processing the search queries.

NOTE: Do keep in mind that you have to navigate to the folder where the program is contained,
or, you could just add it into the system variables altering the PATH variable for ease.

##### As an argument

This method allows you to directly place the search query within quotes, as an argument to be parsed by the program.<br>
A one line method of execution.

```shell
ytsearch.py -s "Your Search Query"
ytsearch.py --search "Your Search Query"
```

##### Running the program

This method allows you to run the program first, and then enter the ****Search Query**** in a seperate line.<br>
No arguments. No problem.

```shell
ytsearch.py
ytsearch 1.0.0 | tinyApps
SearchQuery> Your Search Query
```

And, that's it! You're good to go now.
