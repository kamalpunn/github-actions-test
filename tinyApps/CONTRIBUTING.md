# Contributing
This project is dedicated to bringing about tiny apps that could help a person out on a daily basis, as such we would be delighted to have you
helping us to extend the prospect of tinyApps reducing the stress on you.

But, there does exist a method, or a procedure, to follow in case you wish to contribute to the ```tinyApps``` repository, this helps in reducing clutter,
and provides a better understanding to the maintainers as to what the change proposes, and what the problem statement, as well as solution is.

---

Here's how you can help out.
- [ ] Open up an issue, describing the problem statement, or the update that you wish to bring in.
- [ ] Fork the repository and work on the feature that you wish to add into the repository.
- [ ] With each commit, do specify what was the change that you have made.
- [ ] After you're done with it, and find that the work is at completion, send out a pull request to the main repository.
- [ ] Now, wait for the maintainers to check into it, and review it.

If you're pull request is rejected, don't feel bad about it.
The maintainers will provide a reason why, and whether you could make any changes for the pull request to be accepted.

Thank you for contributing.
